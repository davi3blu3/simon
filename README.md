## Simon Game

This is the final project for freeCodeCamp.com front end developer curriculum. It is a recreation of the old Simon memory game.

Press 'Start' to initiate the computer's turn, and then mimic the musical and color sequence to progress. Getting the sequence wrong results in an error tone, and the computer will play the current sequence again. Enable 'Strict' mode and the game will start over after a mistake. After 20 correct rounds you are declared a winner.
